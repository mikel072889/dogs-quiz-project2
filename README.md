# WHO LET THE DOGS OUT?
"WHO LET THE DOGS OUT?" is an interactive quiz about man's bestfriend, dogs. It targets those who consider themselves as pet lovers, pet enthusiasts, dog gurus, dog trainers, of even those who know nothing about dogs but want to immerse themselves in this simple but challenging quiz!

It consists of multiple choice questions which are displayed individually with their respective possible answers. There are four options the user can choose from. The quiz also interacts with the user by showing trivias and explanations related to the question or correct answer once an option is clicked. 

The quiz is designed to be immersive by utilising a storyline that users can read before engaging with the quiz. From the title itself, the storyline revolves around the user being tasked to look after the dogs in a kennel but something goes wrong! In the story, the dogs got out and the only way to find them is by answering the quiz questions! One correct answer equates to one dog found, and one wrong answer equates to one dog lost!

            * Wrong answer clicked - when the wrong answer is clicked by the user, the whole quiz area background color changes to a mildly reddish color warning the user of a wrong answer chosen and/or of a "lost dog". The chosen wrong answer background color also changes to a more saturated red color. All these is expected to generate the feeling of unease to the user and will certainly prompt them to do better on the following questions. Due to this, the color changes are not designed to fullfil accessibility contrast criteria but are still considerably readable and  the users can still carry on with the quiz.
