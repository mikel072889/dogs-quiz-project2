# WHO LET THE DOGS OUT?
"WHO LET THE DOGS OUT?" is an interactive quiz about man's bestfriend, dogs. It targets those who consider themselves as pet lovers, pet enthusiasts, dog gurus, dog trainers, of even those who know nothing about dogs but want to immerse themselves in this simple but challenging quiz!

It consists of 30 multiple choice questions which are displayed individually with their respective possible answers. There are four options the user can choose from. The quiz also interacts with the user by showing trivias and explanations related to the question or correct answer once an option is clicked. 

The quiz is designed to be immersive by utilising a storyline that users can read before engaging with the quiz. From the title itself, the storyline revolves around the user being tasked to look after the dogs in a kennel but something goes wrong! In the story, the dogs got out and the only way to find them is by answering the quiz questions! One correct answer equates to one dog found, and one wrong answer equates to one dog lost!

The quiz can be accessed though this live site [here](https://mikel072889.github.io/dogs-quiz-project2/).

    * Start Quiz Button
        * The start quiz button is not labelled "Start Quiz" for a reason. The button is labelled "Let's go find your dogs!" to add more consistency with the storyline.
        * This button will take the user to the initial quiz question. 
        * It features the hover effect and changes background color and mouse pointer when hovered upon. This signals the user that they are about to start the quiz once button is clicked.

    * Dogs Found and Dogs Lost Scoring System 
        * "Dogs Found"  is where the number of correct answers will be shown and is expected to increment everytime the user clicks on the correct answer. On the other hand, "Dogs Lost" is where the number of wrong answers will be shown and is also expected to increment everytime user clicks on the wrong answer. 
        * Contrary to the usual scoring label "Score", this are is labelled differently to provide consistency with the storyline.

        [comment]: # (Final image of the scoring system here.)

    * Options area
        * Four options is displayed for the user to choose from
        * Interactivities included:
            * Hover effect - when hovered upon, texts shift to the left and background color changes. This contributes to visual interactivity of the buttons and allows users to navigate around tese buttons that will tell them exactly what their pointing at.

            [comment]: # (Final image of a button being hovered upon here.)

            * Correct answer clicked - when the correct answer is clicked by the user, the background color of the correct answer changes to green and all button's hover effect is disabled limiting the user to choose other options once an option is clicked. The background color the the wrong answers also goes darker to put emphasis that these are the wrong answers. The correct answer background color is turned green to generate a positive feeling from the user.

            [comment]: # (Final image of a button with the correct answer clicked here.)

            * Wrong answer clicked - when the wrong answer is clicked by the user, the whole quiz area background color changes to a mildly reddish color warning the user of a wrong answer chosen and/or of a "lost dog". The chosen wrong answer background color also changes to a more saturated red color while the other unchosen wrong answers to a less saturated red color. All these is expected to generate the feeling of unease to the user and will certainly prompt them to do better on the following questions. Due to this, the color changes are purposely not designed to fullfil accessibility contrast criteria but are still considerably readable and  the users can still carry on with the quiz.

    * Comment and Trivia area
        * This is where the result of the question is displayed to show the user whether the user chose the correct answer or not. 

        [comment]: # (Final image of the comment and trivia area here.)

        * To maintain consistency, either one of these two comments are expected to be displayed once triggered: 
            * "YOU FOUND A DOG!" - This signifies a correct answer chosen and will also be displayed with an image of a dancing dog at the same time. Again, this is to generate excitement on the user and will want to see more of this dancing dog in the next questions. 

            [comment]: # (Final image of correct answer comment and dancing dog gif here.)

            * "OOOPPS! YOU LOST ONE DOG!" - This signifies a wrong answer and will also be displayed with an image of a sad dog at the same time. This will generate a negative feeling from the user from choosing the wrong answer. 

            [comment]: # (Final image of wrong answer comment and sad dog gif here.)

        * Trivia area - regardless of the result, once an answer has been clicked for every question, a trivia will pop out at the bottom of the page and will display a trivia related to the question and/or the correct answer. Not only that this quiz is designed to test users' dog knowledge, but is also designed to give the user important information about dogs. This provides good learning opportunity to users.

        [comment]: # (Final image of a sample of a trivia here.)

    * Next Question button 
        * The next question button or the "Hurry! Find more dogs!" button is provided to navigate to the next question. 
        * Interactivities included: 
            * Hover effect - changes background color and cursor on hover
        * Note: The quiz is purposely designed to NOT have a back button to navigate back to previous questions. This will defeat the storyline purpose of finding lost dogs in time!

        [comment]: # (Final image of the next question button here.)

* End Game Area
    * This area only displays once the quiz is done. This will show the final result of the quiz including the final tally of dogs found and dogs lost. 

    [comment]: # (Final image of the final tally of the scores here.)

    * In the middle is the final concluding comments still in consistency with the siryline and will show one of these three comments depending on the user's final score: 
    
    [comment]: # (Three images of the concluding comments per score range here.)

    * Back button and result-based image of a dog
        * The back button or the "Back to the kennel" button navigates back to the instructions area and will allow the user to revisit the storyline or instructions of the quiz and retake the quiz.
        * An image of a happy or sad dog will also be displayed and will depend on the user score.

        [comment]: # (Final image of Back button with the result-based image here.)

    * Retake Quiz
        * This button will immediately redirect the user to the first question of the quiz.

### Features to Implement
   * In the future, I would like to improve on this game by including a save score functionality and to be able to display high scores with their corresponding usernames.
   * I also plan to add audio interactivity, for example, wrong answer and correct answer will have their own respective sounds when clicked. It would be more immersive if there is a background sound playing while taking the quiz.
   * I also plan to expand this project to a higher scope, for example, a quiz website that can feature a selection of quiz per pet category. Dogs quiz is just one of them!

### Favicon

* The quiz page features a favicon with a cartoon image of a dog telling the user that this page is about dogs. This can facilitate easier navigation for users when they have multiple tabs open in one window.
