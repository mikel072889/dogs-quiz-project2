          <p>Your family runs a kennel in the outskirts of Manchester. Today, you were
            left in-charge of the place. Your kennel is currently housing 30 adorable
            dogs. Unfortunately, somebody left the main door open this morning and all
            of the 30 cute dogs managed to escape!
          </p>
          <p>You now need to find those dogs by answering all the questions in this
            quiz game. One correct answer is equivalent to one dog being found.
          </p>
          <p>Will you manage to find them all? Let's see how many dogs you can find!
            Otherwise, we'll get RSPCA involved!
